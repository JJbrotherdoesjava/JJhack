JJhack is a 1.12.2 utility mod designed to be used in HvH combat

First thought about on december 15th 2020 by JJbrother in a socknoodles vc with 1sthoudini, Peared, Shredda, Neroga and some other guy idk 
The first release of JJhack was called meow hack a renamed JAR file of gamesense I claimed to know how to code but had no clue at all
I would like to bring this idea back up since ive been working on it since about may when I first learned how to code in java I decided to release it to the public
Becuase of its never before seen modules even notable clients with huge followings such as Phobos, Wurst, Future, RusherHack and more. Everything in here is custom every single module HUD and even the base is custom the only thing skidded was the HWID lock I might set on the BETA version of JJhack to prevent deobfuscating the file and sharing the file having other people take credit for my work. I will probably be teaming up with other developers to help me since I have school and other things that come before this but I will work on JJhack in my freetime thank you for supporting JJhack!
