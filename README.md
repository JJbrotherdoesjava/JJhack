# JJhack

JJhack is a 1.12.2 utility mod designed to be used in HvH combat

First thought about on december 15th 2020 by JJbrother in a socknoodles vc with 1sthoudini, Peared, Shredda, Neroga and some other guy idk 

First release was named ¨cat client¨ a skid of gamesense ¨fortnitegod.cc¨ which I used as ¨cat client¨ It was just a renamed JAR file lol 

At the time I had no clue about coding whatsoever I didnt even know any languages I was just bored and had nothing to do 

Now learning Java throught 2021 I wanted to reopen this idea and make a real client with real known developers for personal use.

Started in about May of 2021 work begins I first start off with a custom base but realize it was to much work I then use phobos base taking everything out and just using the base of it working on JJhack every day I have developed some very strong modules and ideas for other modules never seen before in other clients

I decided I am going to release JJhack to a small amount of people pottentially with a HWID lock to try to prevent people from deopfuscating to JAR or sharing it 

I would rather take credit for JJhack thats why Ive decided to team up with a few devs and to make a veyr good well known client in the community
